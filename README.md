# Description
To describe behavioral plasticity in the honey bee (Apis melifera), we analyze single nuclei transcriptomic of brain from nurses and foragers (two typical social divisions).

These scripts are mainly used in our analysis, including:
(1) Single nuclei RNA data integration and clustering
(2) Statistics for cell type frequency
(3) Differential gene-expression between groups based on pseudo bulk
(4) SCENIC analysis
(5)Cross-species cell type similarity analysis
