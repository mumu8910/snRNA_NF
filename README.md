# Description
We analyze single nuclei transcriptomic of  brain from nurses and foragers (two typical social divisions), to describe behavioral plasticity in the honey bee (Apis melifera).

These scripts are mainly used in our analysis, including:
(1) Single nuclei RNA data integration and clustering. 
(2) Statistics for cell type frequency. 
(3) Differential gene-expression between groups based on pseudo bulk. 
(4) SCENIC analysis. 

Tips:
If you want to use our scripts for analysis, some parameters needs to be modified according to your own environment.
